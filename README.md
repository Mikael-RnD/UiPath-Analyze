# UiPath-Analyze
Runs [workflow analysis](https://docs.uipath.com/studio/standalone/2023.10/user-guide/about-workflow-analyzer) with stopOnRuleViolation enabled for all UiPath projects in a GitHub repository. Built as a wrapper around the UiPath CLI task for [Analyzing a Project](https://docs.uipath.com/test-suite/automation-cloud/latest/user-guide/analyzing-a-project).

The action adds comments to the GitHub Actions step summary, containing a table of information about the workflow analysis results, and provides the path of a JSON file for workflow analysis results.

Example usage:

      # Action for packing UiPath projects in a repository
